Mykilio is the proposal for a new Living Standard with the goal to reimagine infrastructure management and monitoring. It aims to be scalable, lightweight, extensible and secure by applying IoT principles to the datacenter and homelabs.

## 📊 Statistics

Here are some statistics to document my learnings throughout the development process.

| 💣 Fault         | 📈 Occurrences | 😅 Poor excuse                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reverse polarity | 1              | Maybe purple and dark grey were not the best choice for +24V and GND.                                   |
| Overvoltage      | 1              | I have shaky hands and why does everything have to be so small?!                                        |
| Short-circuit    | 1              | Next time I am going to solder proper connectors. Promise!                                              |
| Wrong footprint  | 2              | Why do TQFP and DIP have a different pin numbering!?<br/>It was late and SS/TR is very close to RT/CLK. |
